- Developed a deep learning model using PyTorch for object localization, enabling precise identification and localization of objects within images.
- Implemented advanced techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning with pre-trained models, and custom dataset creation to enhance model performance and accuracy.
- Successfully trained and evaluated the model, achieving significant improvements in object localization accuracy compared to traditional computer vision techniques.
